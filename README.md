Recently, I returned to China from London. Because of coronavirus, international travel has become particularly difficult, especially back to China. And for a variety of reasons, my journey became very unfortunate, so I came up with the idea of creating this project.


I hope to complete the development of AR games through Unity in the final project. Thanks to Professor Phoenix Perry for her inspiration, I decided to take a self-taught Unity AR course and combine the Unity technology I learned in the previous semester.


Sorry for the bad environment, this quarantine hotel is older than me.
